    <p>‘The technology is tired’ is a story about an entity who tries to surpass the ‘technology of reality’, they attempt to cope with their reality by recreating it. Their ‘love letter’ to the universe is embodied by the act of creation - specifically, Machine is creating the highest, most sophisticated technology possible, hoping to one day, create the universe itself – <i>a suicidal hommage.</i></p>

  <div class="popup" id="2">
    <p>As Ursula K. Le Guin puts it, “technology is how a society copes with physical reality.”<br>꩜<br>“A creature named Machine sits, thinking of all the ways it could create the universe. Every hour of every day, Machine is writing its love letter to the universe. Everytime, it goes something like this …… ”</p>

    <p>This story explores the idea that we don't have to create or invent a beautiful, epic world in order to be apart of one. We can contribute to one that already exists. There is no need to romanize a utopia, as always wanting a positive experience is a negative experience.<br><br>꩜

    Extended Write Up Info:<br><br>
    ‘The technology is tired’ is ultimately an interactive story (with the genre of ‘dystopian fable’) that showcases two sides: (1) a story following a character who’s learning what it means to coexist with the earth and moderate their technological progress, and (2) a harsh mechanical moderator who does not want you to see this plausible future.<br><br>
    This machine works by detecting if the viewer’s eyes are opened or closed. If the user’s eyes are open, the story stops and the moderator sternly tells you to close your eyes. If the user’s eyes are closed, the moderator is satisfied enough, and the play will continue. Servo motors open and close the stage curtains, move the rotating stage, and flip the stagefront, all timed to the audio track playing on a webfile which sends commands (via p5 serial control)  to the arduino in order to move the stage.<br><br>
    I was inspired to create this project mainly because I wanted to push the limits of minimal user-interaction (in this case, it’s just opening and closing your eyes), yet still be able to have an immersive experience. I also wanted to explore a storytelling medium as it’s something I have very little experience in. Conceptually, I was inspired by two main essays: Ursula K. Le Guin’s ‘A rant about ‘technology’’ and Jacob Geller’s ‘The False Evolution of Execution Methods.’ While they both tackle radically different topics, their commentary meets in the middle: ultimately prompting us to think about trivial technological progression and our infatuation with the future.

    <p>A few quotes from these sources:</p>
    <div>
      <p>“Technology” and “hi tech” are not synonymous, and a technology that isn’t “hi,” isn’t necessarily “low” in any meaningful sense. [...] <br><br> We have been so desensitized by a hundred and fifty years of ceaselessly expanding technical prowess that we think nothing less complex and showy than a computer or a jet bomber deserves to be called "technology " at all. As if linen were the same thing as flax — as if paper, ink, wheels, knives, clocks, chairs, aspirin pills, were natural objects, born with us like our teeth and fingers – as if steel saucepans with copper bottoms and fleece vests spun from recycled glass grew on trees, and we just picked them when they were ripe…<br><br>-Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
      <p>“We excuse the practices of today via the specter  of previous barbarism. [...] not only have we found a new solution, but the old solution was brutish, crash, inhumane. This new solution always represents a  new era,  the most evolved, the most enlightened. That is until, it too is rendered barbaric by the next developmental line.”<br><br>-Jacob Geller</p>
      <p>“In general, American [science fiction] has assumed a permanent hierarchy of superiors and inferiors, with rich, ambitious, aggressive males at the top, then a great gap, and then at the bottom the poor, the uneducated, the faceless masses, and all the women. The whole picture is, if I may say so, curiously "un-American." It is a perfect baboon patriarchy, with the Alpha Male on top, being respectfully groomed, from time to time, by his inferiors. [...]<br>Is this speculation? is this imagination? is this extrapolation? I call it brainless regressivism.”<br><br>-Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
      <p>“Science fiction novels, on the record, have not been measurably effective social criticism [...] The science fiction novel does contain social criticism, explicit and implicit, but I believe this criticism is massively outweighed by unconscious symbolic material more concerned with the individual's relationship to his family and the raw universe than with the individual's relationship to society.<br><br>-C. M. Kornbluth</p>
      <p>“... In 1954 Ellul saw the beast emerging in infant form. Technology, he wrote, can’t put up with human values and ‘must necessarily don mathematical vestments. Everything in human life that does not lend itself to mathematical treatment must be excluded… Who is too blind to not see that a profound mutation is being advocated here?’”<br><br>-Jacques Ellul</p>

        As this is a prototype, moving forward future incorporations include: <br><br>
        - Hall monitor sensor and magnet for detecting the start of the rotating stage<br>
        - DC motors within the stage sets<br>
        - LEDs within the stage sets<br>
        - Spotlight, via an LED with a magnifier<br>
        - Running the program on raspberry pi and USB webcam<br>
        - Hologram setup on top of the raspberry pi screen<br> 
        - A fourth motor so the second stagefront ‘mouth’ closes from above<br>
